### Github Flavored Title

This is a gitHub Flavored paragraph example that uses Copy graph is located under the File program menu. It copies the active graph including titles, legends, slide bars and data descriptions to the clipboard in JPEG (.jpg) format using the default compression. The plot can then be inserted into other
programs such as Word or PowerPoint for reports or presentation. A similar command is to use Alt-Print Screen to capture the active graph on to the clipboard as a Windows bitmap. In this case, you will have to use a graphics file editor to remove the window portion from around the graph.
